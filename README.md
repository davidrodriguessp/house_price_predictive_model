# Building a Machine Learning Model to Predict House Prices

Imagine you wake up one morning and receive some news. A distant relative passed away, and left a big house to you in the United States. You did not know her, and your first thought is to try to understand the value of the house. You know the size of the house in square feet is important, but you start thinking about other characteristics:
- What is the general state of the property?
- Does it have a swimming pool?
- How many bathrooms?
- What type of neighborhood are we talking about?

It turns out it is not so easy to determine the sale price.

The objective of this project is to build a model to predict houses sale price, based on the characteristics of the property. We have built a machine learning model, based on housing data for the city of Ames, Iowa, United States from 2006 to 2010. 

The dataset has roughly 3,000 houses and includes 82 columns with various features that might be relevant to determine the sale price.

Two files are available in this repository:
- predicting_house_prices.ipynb with a notebook with the full report
- AmesHousing.txt with the dataset
